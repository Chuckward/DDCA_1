* Sidenode: The (additional) measurement for the RS232 transmission was done separately 
	from the measurement for textmode controller, since both interfere with each other.

    measured when the seven segment display output bus changes its value and
    multiple signals toggle?}

\begin{qa}
  \question{Which baudrate did you use for the above simulation?
    How long should the transmission take for the whole frame (including start and
    stop bit)?
    What is the time you measured in the simulation (not including the stop
    bit)?}
  \answer{I've chosen 9600 baud as transmission speed since it is widely spread and well supported. One baud consists of 10 bit, start/stop and 8 data bits, which means, 96000 bit are transmitted in 1 second. A frame should take about $\frac{1}{96000 bit} = 10.47 \mu s$ to transfer. }
